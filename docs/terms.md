# Notes on Terminology, Spelling, Vocabulary Conventions

## Spelling and Vocabulary conventions

1. Almost all of the english words are written in British English. For example, "organisation" instead of "organization", "synchronisation" instead of "synchronization", etc. This convention originated from the author's personal preference but is now maintained for consistency.

2. Idiomatic terms, such as used in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, are usually be aligned with the language used in the technology. For example, "color" instead of "colour", "program" instead of "programme", etc. Especially, terms which are used for attributes, properties, and methods are notable.

3. We use `dialogue` in documentation for consistency. While `dialog` may appear in source code, particularly in class names, method names, and attributes (following technical conventions in No. 2), we consistently use `dialogue` for user-facing messages and general documentation text. This approach balances No. 1 with No. 2.

4. Contractions are not used. For example, "do not" instead of "don't", "cannot" instead of "can't", etc. especially `'d`.
   - We may encounter difficulties with tenses.

5. However, try using affirmative forms, `Discard` instead of `Do not keep`, `Continue` instead of `Do not stop`, etc.
    - Some languages, such as Japanese, have a different meaning for `yes` and `no` between affirmative and negative questions.

## Terminology

- Self-hosted LiveSync
    - This plug-in name. `Self-hosted` is one word.
- LiveSync
    - Very confusing term.
        - As shorten-form of `Self-hosted LiveSync`.
        - As a name of synchronisation mode. This should be changed to `Continuos`, in contrast to `Periodic`.
